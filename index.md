# Geode SDK

**Geode** is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) mod loader and modding SDK with a modern approach towards mod development. Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let devs handle the rest, Geode aims to be a more comprehensive project, which manages loaded mods & hooks itself. Geode has been built to ensure performance, compatibility, portability and ease of use. For devs, Geode means easy development and portability; for end users, Geode means an uniform and easy experience using mods.

> :warning: These docs are intended for **developers** looking to use Geode. If you're someone who would just like to use mods, [see our homepage](https://geode-sdk.org/install).

## Why Geode?

The main goal of Geode is to **end mod incompatibility**. Traditional modding leads very easily to compatability problems, many of which Geode attempts to address with better solutions.

On top of this, and perhaps more interestingly, **Geode provides much better ergonomics for modding**. Instead of having to deal with calling conventions, trampolines, manually setting hooks (likely in another source file), you can have all the code relevant to hooks in a [nice, clean, readable syntax](/tutorials/modify.md) contained within a single source file.

## Help, Contributing, Etc.

If you need help using Geode or would like to contribute, feel free to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9e43WMKzhp).

Alternatively, if you hate joining Discord servers to work with a framework, you can also just **open up an issue or pull request** on any [Geode repository on Github](https://github.com/orgs/geode-sdk/repositories).

## Getting Started

See [Getting Started](/getting-started) for a step by step tutorial on getting started with Geode SDK.

See [Handbook](/handbook/chap0) for a beginner-friendly tutorial series on using Geode and GD Modding in general (WIP!!).
